Question Answering Over Document (**Docs-QA**) has been a hot topic since ChatGPT and other LLM models 
has been launched. The main problem it solves is *Trustworthiness and Adaptation* : it answers the 
user's questions via documents that are provided by user, not  by documents fed to the trained model only.
